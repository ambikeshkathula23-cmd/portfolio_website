Get your personalized portfolio up and running in no time!

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ambikeshkathula23-cmd/portfolio_website.git
    cd portfolio_website
    ```

2.  **View Locally:**
    Since this is a static site, you can simply open `index.html` in your web browser. For a more production-like environment, you can use a simple local server:
    ```bash
    # For Python 3
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
    Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

3.  **Customize Your Content:**
    *   Edit `projects/projects.json` to add or update your project details.
    *   Modify `skills.json` to reflect your technical skillset.
    *   Update `assests/resume.pdf` with your latest CV.
    *   Personalize `index.html`, `experience/index.html`, and `projects/index.html` with your personal information and details.

4.  **Deploy (Optional):**
    The `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file is configured for automated deployment via GitHub Actions. Push your changes to GitHub, and the workflow will handle deployment to your desired static hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
